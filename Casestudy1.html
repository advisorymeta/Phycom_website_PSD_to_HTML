<p class="columntextyellow"><strong>Automating and streamlining data management.</strong></p>
<p class="casestudy1">One of our healthcare clients was working with manual and, therefore, very cumbersome data management processes. 
Several small teams were responsible for different tasks; in addition, they were using multiple tools and software, including Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, Outlook, FTP, shared file locations, and email proxy servers. 
This created bottlenecks and diminished performance.</p><br>

<p class="casestudy1">The problem was compounded by the fact that team members were entrenched in their then-current ways of gathering and managing data, and they were not technology-savvy.</p><br> 

<p class="casestudy1">After arriving at a thorough understanding of key, critical elements, we configured JIRA and Confluence to streamline their entire process and facilitate collaboration between internal and external teams. 
This dramatically reduced their rate of error and increased their status accuracy. Within a year, their operational efficiency doubled while their man-hours decreased by 30 percent.</p>
