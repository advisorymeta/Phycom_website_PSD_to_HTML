<p class="testimonials">&#8220;Phycom has always been easy to work with and they have provided both leadership and talent in both the IT space and the product space.  
I&#39;ve worked with Zubair for over 15 years and have always been impressed with his thoughtfulness and can-do attitude.  He approaches your business issue like a true partner &#8211; he works to understand your pain points (even if you can&#39;t articulate them), what you want the end result to be and works with you to develop an innovative and timely solution.  
It seems on a monthly basis I go to him with a relatively minor, but repeating problem with a legacy issue and in a few hours he&#39;s got an approach to fix it.  
He and his team are key assets to any team with which they are involved.&#8221;</p>

<p class="testimonials">&#8220;Zubair and the Phycom team have been instrumental in helping transform Data Management at the American Medical Association.  
Their ability to effectively collaborate with my team, thoughtfully analyze our legacy operational processes and build out modern workflows in the JIRA platform have been central in driving enhanced measurement and accountability on my team.  
Additionally, their support of our MDM implementation and gleaning requirements from our sometimes convoluted legacy environment has been crucial to the success of this effort.  
I strongly recommend Zubair and the Phycom team to any organization looking to modernize their operational processes and create a work environment driven by measurement and accountability.&#8221;</p> <pre style="font-size: 17px; text-align: right">

<p class="testimonials">&#8220;Zubair and his team can effectively translate business needs to technology solutions and with &#39;whatever it takes&#39; attitude deliver quality products. 
You can count on team to deliver on your technology solution needs.&#8221;</p><pre style="font-size: 17px; text-align: right">
